## Being Effective

We want to hopefully avoid duplicate work, so to do that we are asking for the following guidelines to be followed when becoming a contributor.

#### Guidelines
- Try to obtain the context of the vision of the task/issue to make sure the contribution will be accepted. Need advice or have a question about the task/issue, just reply and ask or hit us up on Matrix.
- Want to implement something not on the current board, feel free to submit an issue or ask in our Matrix chat so we can provide some feedback and see if it aligns with the project.
- If you run into issues or problems while working on a task/issue and have to abandon it, update the task/issue so that people can pick up where you left off and know it is something they can pick up.

### Matrix Group
