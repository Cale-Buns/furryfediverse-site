				<p class="text-2xl">What is the Furry Fediverse?</p>
				<p>
					We are a collection of furry instances on the Fediverse, which is just a fancy way of saying
					we are a bunch of servers that federate together allowing furries to join the wider Fediverse.
					To ease the confusion, Fediverse just means a collection of servers that all communicate with 
					each other. Matodon, Pleroma, Pixelfed, and more are all software that speak Activity Pub which 
					is the protocol the Fediverse runs on.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is no ownership of the wider Fediverse, just instances. All instances are operated by 
					real people and not faceless companies(or at least the ones listed on this site). Which means 
					you are moderated by other real furries and server costs are managed by your instance admins. 
					Or if you are nerdy enough, you can host your own and federate with the rest of us!
				</p>

			<div class="bg-gray-200 text-slate-800 rounded-md p-3">
				<p class="text-2xl">Getting Started</p>
				<p>
					Joining is really simple and easy, just pick a server from below to get started. Or if you are 
					nerdy like stated before setup your own server... but I still think it is best to start out on 
					an existing instance first. You will be able to move easily with all your followers if you want.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Note:</strong> You may feel like you should join a LARGE instance, but you should keep in 
					mind the larger the instance, the most costly it is on your instance owner. Also it doens't matter 
					what instance you are on, as you can follow and people can follow you no matter which instance you 
					join. We are all interconnected!
